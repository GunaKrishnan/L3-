Inter-area OSPF behaves like a distance vector protocol. Albeit OSPF is a link state protocol, the way OSPF handles inter-area traffic leaves it prone to routing loops. This is why OSPF must connect back to area 0 â€“ to avoid routing loops. Now you can see why network designs that use OSPF all join back to area 0 and why it is important to ensure virtual links are used as band-aids only.
